This is a comprehensive set of tools for maps from James Bond 007: Nightfire (PC) in BSP form. Tools include:

BSP structure optimizer: Reuses duplicate data structures and deletes the entities which don't matter to the game. This won't miraculously shrink a badly done map, but it will shave a couple kilobytes off your map. Recommended for map developers, just before releasing their maps.

BSP map decompiler: Attemps to recreate a .MAP file (compatible with GearCraft 5.0) from the .BSP file. Recommended for those just curious about how things work.

And other tools.

Please note this project is very much a work in progress and not all features may be implemented or functional at this time. Please see the issues tracker for more information, or to report a bug.
