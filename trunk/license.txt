The badly written source code for James Bond 007: NightFire BSP lump tools is completely open and free for all to use. This means you can do whatever you want with it. You can port it for use with another game or format of the BSP, you can tattoo it on yourself, you can use any part of any or all of the files for your own devices and you can delete it from your hard drive. You can bake it into a cake and eat it, if you like. All I ask is you add a small note stating where you got it, because plagiarism is a bad idea. If you don't, though, I'm not going to persue any legal action or anything, I'm far too lazy for that.
